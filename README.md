# Maze
HTML, CSS, JavaScript application that generates maze of 3 different difficulties and challenges you to solve it.
It uses DFS algorithm with random selection of direction of path with one trick that I figured.
# Rules
You start in bottom right corner and use keyboard arrows to move arround.<br /><br />
Your goal is to reach upper left corner. <br /><br />
If you wish to reset the level, just refresh the site. <br /><br />
Try to figure it out.<br /><br />
**Good luck!**<br /><br />
Hint: backwards<br /><br />
